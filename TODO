Current active misfeatures

    o   Rcpp.package.skeleton() does not work with supplied functions,
        eg Rcpp.package.skeleton("foo", list=c("funA", "funB")) ends
        in error.

    o   Sugar ops unit tests on +, -, ... need double, fail with int

    o   DataFrame::create(Named("a")=b, Named("b")=b) fails with
        NumericVectors

Documentation

    o	Finish the quickref vignette
    
    o	Maybe a vignette about stats functions
    
    o   Add a vignette about the API

API

    o   Rcpp::Factor and Rcpp::Ordered

    o   Fast indexing and g++ 4.5.0 or later: open issue of why this compiler
        gets upset when the previous version(s) coped just fine
        
    o   Vector::resize    

Modules 
        
    o   Class inheritance. Reflect C++ inheritance at the R level. 
        
Syntactic sugar

    o	logical indexing, ie NumericVector( LogicalVector ) 

    o	recycling : binary operators and math functions of 2 or more arguments
        need to recycle their arguments. 
    
    o	not sure rep should be lazy, i.e. rep( x, 4 ) fetches x[i] 4 times, 
	maybe we should use LazyVector like in outer to somehow cache the
	result when it is judged expensive to calculate
	
    o 	crossprod
	
    o	Vector * Matrix, Matrix * Matrix

    o   operator% 
    
    o   operator/ needs to handle the case of division by 0

    o   matrix functions : apply
    
    o   for character vectors: nchar, grepl, sub, gsub
    
    o   Compound operators: ++,--,+=, -=, ...
    
    o	other statistical distribution functions : 
    	
    	multinom : this only has dmultinom which is handled in R, so
   	maybe we can skip it
    	
    	signrank : has the weird call to .C( "signrank_free" ), need
   	to understand that
    	
    	wilcox : has the weird call to .C( "wilcox_free" ), need to
   	understand that
    	
    	tukey : only has p and q, no r or d
    
    o	other random generators: 
    
    	rmultinom : tricky because it generates a matrix
    	
    	rnbeta : the R version is implemented in R (not in C), 
    	should we still have it in Rcpp in compile code ?
    	
    	rnf : idem
    	
    	rnt : idem

Testing

    o	all r* functions : rnorm, etc ...
	
    o	many dpq functions have not been tested yet
	
    o	new autogenerated sugar functions: cos, acosh, atan, cos, cosh, log, 
	log10, sqrt, sin, sinh, tan, tanh    
	
    o   attributes (although our tests currently use attributes extensively
    so it's not clear what else we'd add here)
