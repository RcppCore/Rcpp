Documentation

    o   Bring "Rcpp ? NumericVector" into life. The hook is in place, we just need
	to come up with some way to generate useful documentation for it: general
	description of the class, related unit test cases, etc ...
		
    o   Rework ?Rcpp which is mainly old api centric


API:

    o   Rcpp::Date and Rcpp::DateVector 
	
    o   Rcpp::DateTime and Rcpp::DateTimeVector

    o   Rcpp::Factor and Rcpp::Ordered


Modules: 

    o   Exposing constructors. For now we can only construct internal objects 
	with the default constructor of the target class. Maybe we can provide
	some R level dispatch. Maybe look at ?selectMethod
	
    o   Class inheritance. If we have Foo and Bar : public Foo, and we expose
	both Foo and Bar to R, R level class Bar should enjoy methods of Foo
	and the S4 inheritance should reflect the C++ level inheritance
		
    o   Method overloading: methods are currently stored in a map<string,.>
	so there can only be one method for a given name, which defeats C++
	overloading. Maybe we can do better than that. This might also need 
	R level dispatch (?selectMethod)
	

R 2.12.0

    o   Remove the C++ObjectS3 class as it is no longer needed:

Syntactic sugar

    o   duplicated, unique, is_na, count, sum
    
    o	for matrices: row, col, lower_tri, upper_tri
	
    o   other operators: +,-, ...
    
    o	lazy version of sapply as in this thread:
    	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.rcpp/455
    	
    o	lapply
    
    o	for character vectors: nchar, grepl, sub, gsub
