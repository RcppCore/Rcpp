documentation

	*	Bring "Rcpp ? NumericVector" into life. The hook is in place, we just need
		to come up with some way to generate useful documentation for it: general
		description of the class, related unit test cases, etc ...
		
	*	rework ?Rcpp which is mainly old api centric

API:

	*	Rcpp::Date and Rcpp::DateVector
	
	*	Rcpp::DateTime and Rcpp::DateTimeVector

modules: 

	*	exposing constructors. For now we can only construct internal objects 
		with the default constructor of the target class. Maybe we can provide
		some R level dispatch. Maybe look at ?selectMethod
	
	*	class inheritance. If we have Foo and Bar : public Foo, and we expose
		both Foo and Bar to R, R level class Bar should enjoy methods of Foo
		and the S4 inheritance should reflect the C++ level inheritance
		
	*	method overloading: methods are currently stored in a map<string,.>
		so there can only be one method for a given name, which defeats C++
		overloading. Maybe we can do better than that. This might also need 
		R level dispatch (?selectMethod)
	
R 2.12.0

	*	remove the C++ObjectS3 class as it is no longer needed:

sugar

	*	duplicated, unique, is_na, count, sum
	
	*	other operators: +,-, ...
