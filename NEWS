0.7.8   (under development)

    o   new template class SimpleMatrix<int> and generated classes
    	IntegerMatrix, RawMatrix, NumericMatrix, ComplexMatrix and 
    	LogicalMatrix. These classes derived from their Vector 
    	equivalent except that their constructors check that their 
    	input is a matrix. The classes don't/can't however guarantee 
    	that the enclosed SEXP will allways be a matrix

    o	RcppExample et al have been moved to a new package RcppExamples;
        src/Makevars and src/Makevars.win simplified accordingly

    o	Improved src/Makevars.win thanks to Brian Ripley

    o	New examples for 'fast lm' using compiled code: 
        - using GNU GSL and a C interface
        - using Armadillo (http://arma.sf.net) and a C++ interface
        Armadillo is seen as faster for lack of extra copying

0.7.7	2010-02-14

    o	new template classes Rcpp::unary_call and Rcpp::binary_call
    	that facilitates using R language calls together 
    	with STL algorithms.
    	
    o	fixed a bug in Language constructors taking a string as their
    	first argument. The created call was wrong.

0.7.6   2010-02-12

    o   SEXP_Vector (and ExpressionVector and GenericVector, a.k.a List) now
	have methods push_front, push_back and insert that are templated

    o   SEXP_Vector now has int- and range-valued erase() members

    o   Environment class has a default constructor (for RInside)

    o   SEXP_Vector_Base factored out of SEXP_Vector (Effect. C++ #44)

    o   SEXP_Vector_Base::iterator added as well as begin() and end()
        so that STL algorithms can be applied to Rcpp objects

    o   CharacterVector gains a random access iterator, begin() and end() to
	support STL algorithms; iterator dereferences to a StringProxy

    o   Restore Windows build; successfully tested on 32 and 64 bit;

    o   Small fixes to inst/skeleton files for bootstrapping a package

    o   RObject::asFoo deprecated in favour of Rcpp::as<Foo>

0.7.5	2010-02-08

    o 	wrap has been much improved. wrappable types now are :
    	- primitive types : int, double, Rbyte, Rcomplex, float, bool
    	- std::string
    	- STL containers which have iterators over wrappable types:
    	  (e.g. std::vector<T>, std::deque<T>, std::list<T>, etc ...). 
    	- STL maps keyed by std::string, e.g std::map<std::string,T>
    	- classes that have implicit conversion to SEXP
    	- classes for which the wrap template if fully or partly specialized
    	This allows composition, so for example this class is wrappable: 
    	std::vector< std::map<std::string,T> > (if T is wrappable)
    	
    o 	The range based version of wrap is now exposed at the Rcpp::
    	level with the following interface : 
    	Rcpp::wrap( InputIterator first, InputIterator last )
    	This is dispatched internally to the most appropriate implementation
    	using traits

    o	a new namespace Rcpp::traits has been added to host the various
    	type traits used by wrap

    o 	The doxygen documentation now shows the examples

    o 	A new file inst/THANKS acknowledges the kind help we got from others

    o	The RcppSexp has been removed from the library.
    
    o 	The methods RObject::asFoo are deprecated and will be removed
    	in the next version. The alternative is to use as<Foo>.

    o	The method RObject::slot can now be used to get or set the 
    	associated slot. This is one more example of the proxy pattern
    	
    o	Rcpp::VectorBase gains a names() method that allows getting/setting
    	the names of a vector. This is yet another example of the 
    	proxy pattern.
    	
    o	Rcpp::DottedPair gains templated operator<< and operator>> that 
    	allow wrap and push_back or wrap and push_front of an object
    	
    o	Rcpp::DottedPair, Rcpp::Language, Rcpp::Pairlist are less
    	dependent on C++0x features. They gain constructors with up
    	to 5 templated arguments. 5 was choosed arbitrarily and might 
    	be updated upon request.
    	
    o	function calls by the Rcpp::Function class is less dependent
    	on C++0x. It is now possible to call a function with up to 
    	5 templated arguments (candidate for implicit wrap)
    	
    o	added support for 64-bit Windows (thanks to Brian Ripley and Uwe Ligges)
	
0.7.4	2010-01-30

    o	matrix-like indexing using operator() for all vector 
    	types : IntegerVector, NumericVector, RawVector, CharacterVector
    	LogicalVector, GenericVector and ExpressionVector. 

    o	new class Rcpp::Dimension to support creation of vectors with 
    	dimensions. All vector classes gain a constructor taking a 
    	Dimension reference.

    o	an intermediate template class "SimpleVector" has been added. All
    	simple vector classes are now generated from the SimpleVector 
    	template : IntegerVector, NumericVector, RawVector, CharacterVector
    	LogicalVector.

    o	an intermediate template class "SEXP_Vector" has been added to 
    	generate GenericVector and ExpressionVector.

    o	the clone template function was introduced to explicitely
    	clone an RObject by duplicating the SEXP it encapsulates.

    o	even smarter wrap programming using traits and template
        meta-programming using a private header to be include only
        RcppCommon.h

    o 	the as template is now smarter. The template now attempts to 
    	build an object of the requested template parameter T by using the
    	constructor for the type taking a SEXP. This allows third party code
    	to create a class Foo with a constructor Foo(SEXP) to have 
    	as<Foo> for free.

    o	wrap becomes a template. For an object of type T, wrap<T> uses
    	implicit conversion to SEXP to first convert the object to a SEXP
    	and then uses the wrap(SEXP) function. This allows third party 
    	code creating a class Bar with an operator SEXP() to have 
    	wrap for free.

    o	all specializations of wrap :  wrap<double>, wrap< vector<double> >
    	use coercion to deal with missing values (NA) appropriately.

    o	configure has been withdrawn. C++0x features can now be activated
    	by setting the RCPP_CXX0X environment variable to "yes".

    o	new template r_cast<int> to facilitate conversion of one SEXP
    	type to another. This is mostly intended for internal use and 
    	is used on all vector classes

    o	Environment now takes advantage of the augmented smartness
    	of as and wrap templates. If as<Foo> makes sense, one can 
    	directly extract a Foo from the environment. If wrap<Bar> makes
    	sense then one can insert a Bar directly into the environment. 
    	Foo foo = env["x"] ;  /* as<Foo> is used */
	Bar bar ;
	env["y"] = bar ;      /* wrap<Bar> is used */    	

    o	Environment::assign becomes a template and also uses wrap to 
    	create a suitable SEXP

    o	Many more unit tests for the new features; also added unit tests
        for older API

0.7.3	2010-01-21

    o	New R function Rcpp.package.skeleton, modelled after 
    	utils::package.skeleton to help creating a package with support
    	for Rcpp use.

    o	indexing is now faster for simple vectors due to inlining of 
    	the operator[] and caching the array pointer

    o	The class Rcpp::VectorBase was introduced. All vector classes
    	derive from it. The class handles behaviour that is common 
    	to all vector types: length, names, etc ...

    o	exception forwarding is extended to compilers other than GCC
    	but default values are used for the exception class 
    	and the exception message, because we don't know how to do it.

    o	Improved detection of C++0x capabilities

    o	Rcpp::Pairlist gains a default constructor

    o	Rcpp::Environment gains a new_child method to create a new
    	environment whose parent is this
    
    o	Rcpp::Environment::Binding gains a templated implicit 
    	conversion operator
    	
    o	Rcpp::ExpressionVector gains an eval method to evaluate itself
    
    o	Rcpp::ExpressionVector gains a constructor taking a std::string
    	representing some R code to parse. 
    
    o	Rcpp::GenericVector::Proxy gains an assignment operator to deal
    	with Environment::Proxy objects

    o	Rcpp::LdFlags() now defaults to static linking OS X, as it already
        did on Windows; this default can be overridden. 

0.7.2	2010-01-12

    o	a new benchmark was added to the examples directory
    	around the classic convolution example from
    	Writing R extensions to compare C and C++ implementations

    o 	Rcpp::CharacterVector::StringProxy gains a += operator
    
    o	Rcpp::Environment gains an operator[](string) to get/set
    	objects from the environment. operator[] returns an object
    	of class Rcpp::Environment::Binding which implements the proxy
    	pattern. Inspired from Item 30 of 'More Effective C++'
    
    o	Rcpp::Pairlist and Rcpp::Language gain an operator[](int) 
    	also using the proxy pattern

    o	Rcpp::RObject.attr can now be used on the rhs or the lhs, to get 
    	or set an attribute. This also uses the proxy pattern
    	
    o	Rcpp::Pairlist and Rcpp::Language gain new methods push_back
    	replace, length, size, remove, insert
    	
    o	wrap now returns an object of a suitable class, not just RObject
    	anymore. For example wrap( bool ) returns a LogicalVector
    	
    o	Rcpp::RObject gains methods to deal with S4 objects : isS4, 
    	slot and hasSlot
    
    o	new class Rcpp::ComplexVector to manage complex vectors (CPLXSXP)
    
    o	new class Rcpp::Promise to manage promises (PROMSXP)
    
    o	new class Rcpp::ExpressionVector to manage expression vectors
    	(EXPRSXP)

    o	new class Rcpp::GenericVector to manage generic vectors, a.k.a
    	lists (VECSXP)

    o	new class Rcpp::IntegerVector to manage integer vectors (INTSXP)
    
    o	new class Rcpp::NumericVector to manage numeric vectors (REALSXP)
    
    o	new class Rcpp::RawVector to manage raw vectors (RAWSXP)
    
    o	new class Rcpp::CharacterVector to manage character vectors (STRSXP)
    
    o	new class Rcpp::Function to manage functions 
    	(CLOSXP, SPECIALSXP, BUILTINSXP)
    
    o	new class Rcpp::Pairlist to manage pair lists (LISTSXP)
    
    o	new class Rcpp::Language to manage calls (LANGSXP)
    	
    o	new specializations of wrap to deal with std::initializer lists
    	only available with GCC >= 4.4
    	
    o	new R function Rcpp:::capabilities that can query if various
    	features are available : exception handling, variadic templates
    	initializer lists
    	
    o	new set of functions wrap(T) converting from T to RObject
    
    o	new template function as<T> that can be used to convert a SEXP
    	to type T. Many specializations implemented to deal with 
    	C++ builtin and stl types. Factored out of RObject
    	
    o	new class Rcpp::Named to deal with named with named objects 
	in a pairlist, or a call

    o	new class Rcpp::Symbol to manage symbols (SYMSXP)
    
    o	The garbage collection has been improved and is now automatic 
    	and hidden. The user needs not to worry about it at all.
    	
    o	Rcpp::Environment(SEXP) uses the as.environment R function

    o	Doxygen-generated documentation is no longer included as it is both
        too large and too volatile. Zipfiles are provided on the website.
