Rcpp continues and extends earlier work by Dominik Samperi which he initially
contributed directly into the RQuantLib package. Then, during 2005 and 2006,
several releases were made as CRAN packages, first under the name Rcpp and
later under the name RcppTemplate.  However, both packages were left
abandonded after November 2006.

Due to my continued use of Rcpp both within RQuantLib and in other projects,
I took over maintenance and added some extensions which are documented in the
ChangeLog as well as in even more detail in the Subversion logs on R-Forge.

As of November 2009, Dominick has re-commenced maintenance of RcppTemplate
with new releases on CRAN.  This may provide a good opportunity to import
some new ideas into Rcpp as well, time permitting.

Rcpp is in active and open development, and new contributors are invited to
join the R-Forge project.
