This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-testrcpppackage package of
testRcppPackage, an internal test package for the Rcpp package.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were taken from the main Rcpp source repository, they are also
on thee main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and GitHub at 
	http://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'testRcppPackage' to
'r-cran-testrcpppackage' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for
R.
