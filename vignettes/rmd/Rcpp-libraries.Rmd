# Abstract
abstract: |
  We describe how we extend R with an external C++ code library by using the Rcpp
  package. Our working example uses the recent machine learning library and application
  'Corels' providing optimal yet easily interpretable rule lists \citep{arxiv:corels}
  which we bring to R in the form of the \pkg{RcppCorels} package
  \citep{github:rcppcorels}. We discuss each step in the process, and derive a set of
  simple rules and recommendations which are illustrated with the concrete example.

# Introduction

The process of building a new package with Rcpp can range from the very easy---a single
simple C++ function---to the very complex. If, and how, external resources are utilised
makes a big difference as this too can range from the very simple---making use of a
header-only library, or directly including a few C++ source files without further
dependencies---to the very complex. <!-- A recent example of a very involved build with
dependencies on several external libraries which may not be packaged is the \pkg{arrow}
package \citep{CRAN:arrow}. -->

Yet a lot of the important action happens in the middle ground. Packages may bring their
own source code, but also depend on just one or two external libraries. This paper
describes one such approach in detail: how we turned the Corels application
\citep{arxiv:corels,github:corels} (provided as a standalone C++-based executable) into an
R-callable package \pkg{RcppCorels} \citep{github:rcppcorels} via \pkg{Rcpp}
\citep{CRAN:Rcpp,JSS:Rcpp}.

# The Thirteen Key Steps

## Ensure Use of a Suitable license

Before embarking on such a journey, it is best to ensure that the licensing framework is
suitable. Many different open-source licenses exists, yet a few key ones dominate and can
generally be used _with each other_.  There is however a fair amount of possible legalese
involved, so it is useful to check inter-license compatibility, as well as general
usability of the license in question. Several sites can help via license recommendations,
and checks for interoperability. One example is the site at
[choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) (which is backed by GitHub) can help, as
can [tldrlegal.com](https://tldrlegal.com/).  License choice is a complex topic, and
general recommendations are difficult to make besides the key point of sticking to
already-established and known licenses.

## Ensure the Software builds

In order to see how hard it may to combine an external entity, either a program a library,
with R, it helps to ensure that the external entity actually still builds and runs.

This may seem like a small and obvious steps, but experience suggests that it worth
asserting the ability to build with current tools, and possibly also with more than one
compiler or build-system. Consideration to other platforms used by R also matter a great
deal as one of the strengths of the R package system is its ability to cover the three key
operating system families.

## Ensure it still works

This may seem like a variation on the previous point, but besides the ability to _build_
we also need to ensure the ability to _run_ the software.  If the external entity has
tests and demo, it is highly recommended to run them. If there are reference results, we
should ensure that they are still obtained, and also that the run-time performance it
still (at a minimum) reasonable.

## Ensure it is compelling

This is of course a very basic litmus test: is the new software relevant?  Is is helpful?
Would others benefit from having it packaged and maintained?

## Start an Rcpp package

The first step in getting a new package combing R and C++ is often the creation of a new
Rcpp package.  There are several helper functions to choose from. A natural first choice
is `Rcpp.package.skeleton()` from the \pkg{Rcpp} package \citep{CRAN:Rcpp}. It can be
improved by having the optional helper package \pkg{pkgKitten} \citep{CRAN:pkgKitten}
around as its `kitten()` function smooths some rougher edges left by the underlying Base
R function `package.skeleton()`. This step is shown below in then appendix, and
corresponds to the first commit, followed by a first edit of file `DESCRIPTION`.

Any code added by the helper functions, often just a simple `helloWorld()` variant, can be
run to ensure that the package is indeed functional. More importantly, at this stage, we
can also start building the package as a compressed tar archive and run the R checker on
it.

## Integrate External Package

Given a basic package with C++ support, we can now turn to integrating the external
package.  This complexity of this step can, as alluded to earlier, vary from very easy to
very complex.  Simple cases include just depending on library headers which can either be
copied to the package, or be provided by another package such as \pkg{BH} \citep{CRAN:BH}
or \pkg{AsioHeaders} \citep{CRAN:AsioHeaders} or many other examples.

One aspect worth noting is that if you include a type in your function interface it will
also be part of the generated \code{RcppExports.cpp}. In this case adding a file
\code{PACKAGE\_types.h} (where \code{PACKAGE} is to be replaced with the name of your
package) containing the required \code{\#include} statement for the type(s) will permit
compilation; see the 'Rcpp Attributes' vignette for details \citep{CRAN:Rcpp:Attributes}.

It may also be a dependency on a fairly standard library available on most if
not all systems.  The graphics formats bmp, jpeg or png may be an example; text
formats like JSON or XML are another.  One difficulty, though, may be that
_run-time_ support does not always guarantee _compile-time_ support. In these
cases, a `-dev` or `-devel` package may need to be installed.

Here, we use a third approach and copy files. Discussing the two other means
fully is beyond the scope of this shorter note. So in the concrete case of Corels, we

- copied all existing C++ source and header files over into the `src/` directory;
- renamed all header files from `*.hh` to `*.h` to comply with an R preference;
- create a minimal `src/Makevars` file, initially with link instructions for GMP later relaxed to
  conditional use of GMP (see below);
- moved `main.cc` to a subdirectory as we cannot build with another `main()` function (and R will not include files from subdirectories);
- added a minimal R-callable function along with a `logger` instance.

Here, the last step was needed as the file `main.cc` provided a global instance referred
to from other files. Hence, a minimal R-callable wrapper is being added at this stage
(shown in the appendix as well). Actual functionality will be added later.

We will come back to the step concerning the link instructions.

As this point we have a package for R also containing the library we want to add.

## Make the External Code compliant with R Policies

R has fairly strict guidelines, defined both in the _CRAN Repository Policy_ document at
the CRAN website, and in the manual _Writing R Extension_.  Certain standard C and C++
functions are not permitted as their use could interfere with running code from R.  This
includes somewhat obvious recommendations ("do not call `abort`" as it would terminate the
R sessions) but extends to not using native print methods in order to cooperate better
with the input and output facilities of R. So here, and reflecting that last aspect, we
changed all calls to `printf()` to calls to `Rprintf()`.  Similarly, R prefers its own
(well-tested) random-number generators so we replaced one (scaled) call to `random() /
RAND_MAX` with the equivalent call to R's `unif_rand()`.  We also avoided one use of
`stdout` in `rulelib.h`.

The requirement for such changes may seem excessive at first, but the value added stemming
from consistent application of the CRAN Policies is appreciated by most R users.

## Complete the Interface

In order to further test the package, and of course also for actual use, we need to expose
the key parameters and arguments. Corels parsed command-line arguments; we can translate
this directly into suitable arguments for the main function.  At a first pass, we created the
following interface:

```c++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
bool corels(std::string rules_file,
            std::string labels_file,
            std::string log_dir,
            std::string meta_file = "",
            bool run_bfs = false,
            bool calculate_size = false,
            bool run_curiosity = false,
            int curiosity_policy = 0,
            bool latex_out = false,
            int map_type = 0,
            int verbosity = 0,
            int max_num_nodes = 100000,
            double regularization = 0.01,
            int logging_frequency = 1000,
            int ablation = 0) {

  // actual function body omitted
}
```

Rcpp facilities the integration by adding another wrapper exposing all the function
arguments, and setting up required arguments without default (the first three) along with
optional arguments given a default.  The user can now call `corels()` from R with three
required arguments (the two input files plus the log directory) as well as number of
optional arguments.

## Add Sample Data

R package can access data files that are shipped with them.  That is very useful feature,
and we therefore also copy in the files include in the Corels repository and its `data/`
directory.

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("../../../rcppcorels/inst/sample_data")
```

## Set up working example

Combining the two preceding steps, we can now offer an illustrative example. It is
included in the help page for function `corels()` and can be run from R via
`example("corels")`.

```r
library(RcppCorels)

.sysfile <- function(f)   # helper function
  system.file("sample_data",f,package="RcppCorels")

rules_file <- .sysfile("compas_train.out")
label_file <- .sysfile("compas_train.label")
meta_file <- .sysfile("compas_train.minor")
logdir <- tempdir()

stopifnot(file.exists(rules_file),
          file.exists(labels_file),
          file.exists(meta_file),
          dir.exists(logdir))

corels(rules_file, labels_file, logdir, meta_file,
       verbosity = 100,
       regularization = 0.015,
       curiosity_policy = 2,   # by lower bound
       map_type = 1) 	       # permutation map

cat("See ", logdir, " for result file.")
```

In the example, we pass the two required arguments for rules and labels files, the
optional argument for the 'meta' file as well as an added required argument for the output
directory.  R policy prohibits writing in user-directories, we default to using the
temporary directory of the current session, and report its value at the end.  For other
arguments default values are used.

## Finesse Library Dependencies

One common difficulty when bringing an external library to R via a package consists in dealing with
an external dependency. In the case of 'Corels', the GNU GMP library for multi-precision arithmetic
is an optional extension which, if available, improves and accelerates internal processing.

The simplest approach is to declare a compile-time variable in the `src/Makevars` file. Using
`-DGMP` _defines_ the `GMP` variable at the level of the C and C++ code. One can then condition on
the variable. A very standard approach, also used here is `#if defined(GMP) ... #else ... #endif`
where one of the two code branches is in effect depending on whether the `GMP` variable is defined
or not.

In order to detect presence of a required (or optional) library, tools like 'autoconf' or 'cmake'
are often used.  For example, one can rely of an existing 'autoconf' macro provided by the GMP
documentation to detect presence of the the GNU GMP header and library. We are making use of this
facility here to deploy GMP when it is available.  As 'Corels' can be built with and without GMP,
the build and installation succeeds either way---but deployment of the more-featureful variant with
use GMP is automated.

## Finalise License and Copyright

It is good (and common) practice to clearly attribute authorship. Here, credit is given to
the 'Corels' team and authors as well as to the authors of the underlying 'rulelib' code
used by 'Corels' via the file `inst/AUTHORS` (which will be installed as `AUTHORS` with
the package. In addition, the file `inst/LICENSE` clarifies the GNU GPL-3 license for 'RcppCorels' and 'Corels', and the MIT license for 'rulelib'.

## Additional Bonus: Some more 'meta' files

Several files help to improve the package. For example, `.Rbuildignore` allows to exclude
listed files from the resulting R package keeping it well-defined. Similarly, `.gitignore`
can exclude files from being added to the `git` repository.  We also like `.editorconfig`
for consistent editing default across a range of modern editors.

# Summary

We describe s series of steps to turn the standalone library 'Corels' describes by
\citet{arxiv:corels} into a R package \pkg{RcppCorels} using the facilities offered by
\pkg{Rcpp} \citep{CRAN:Rcpp}.  Along the way, we illustrate key aspects of the R package
standards and CRAN Repository Policy proving a template for other research software
wishing to provide their implementations in a form that is accessibly by R users.

## Appendix 2: A Minimal src/Makevars

In the file shown here, use of GMP is unconditional: we define `GMP` as a compiler flag, and
instruct the linker to link with the GMP library.

```sh

CXX_STD = CXX11

PKG_CXXFLAGS = -I. -DGMP

PKG_LIBS = $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS) -lgmp

```

#include "queue.h"

/*
 * Logs statistics about the execution of the algorithm and dumps it to a file.
 * To turn off, pass verbosity <= 1
 */
NullLogger* logger;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
bool corels() {
  return true;                  // more to fill in, naturally
