Description: The 'Rcpp' package provides R functions as well as C++ classes which
 offer a seamless integration of R and C++. Many R data types and objects can be
 mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both writing of new
 code as well as easier integration of third-party libraries. Documentation 
 about 'Rcpp' is provided by several vignettes included in this package, via the 
 'Rcpp Gallery' site at <http://gallery.rcpp.org>, the paper by Eddelbuettel and 
 Francois (2011, JSS), the book by Eddelbuettel (2013, Springer) and the paper
 by Eddelbuettel and Balamuta (2017, PeerJ); see 'citation("Rcpp")' for details.
