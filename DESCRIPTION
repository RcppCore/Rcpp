Description: The Rcpp package provides a C++ library which facilitates the 
 integration of R and C++.
 .
 R data types (SEXP) are matched to C++ objects in a class hierarchy.  All R
 types are supported (vectors, functions, environment, etc ...)  and each
 type is mapped to a dedicated class. For example, numeric vectors are
 represented as instances of the Rcpp::NumericVector class, environments are
 represented as instances of Rcpp::Environment, functions are represented as
 Rcpp::Function, etc ... The "Rcpp-introduction" vignette provides a good
 entry point to Rcpp. 
 .
 Conversion from C++ to R and back is driven by the templates Rcpp::wrap 
 and Rcpp::as which are highly flexible and extensible, as documented
 in the "Rcpp-extending" vignette.
 .
 Rcpp also provides Rcpp modules, a framework that allows exposing 
 C++ functions and classes to the R level. The "Rcpp-modules" vignette
 details the current set of features of Rcpp-modules. 
 .
 Rcpp includes a concept called Rcpp sugar that brings many R functions
 into C++. Sugar takes advantage of lazy evaluation and expression templates
 to achieve great performance while exposing a syntax that is much nicer
 to use than the equivalent low-level loop code. The "Rcpp-sugar" vignette
 gives an overview of the feature
 .
 Several examples are included, and 735 unit tests in 329 unit test functions
 provide additional usage examples.
