Description: GNU R package for Seamless R and C++ Integration
 The Rcpp package provides a C++ library which facilitates the
 integration of R and C++.
 .
 R data types (SEXP) are matched to C++ objects in a class hierarchy.  All R
 types are supported (vectors, functions, environment, etc ...)  and each
 type is mapped to a dedicated class. For example, numeric vectors are
 represented as instances of the Rcpp::NumericVector class, environments are
 represented as instances of Rcpp::Environment, functions are represented as
 Rcpp::Function, etc ... The "Rcpp-introduction" vignette provides a good
 entry point to Rcpp. 
 .
 Conversion from C++ to R and back is driven by the templates Rcpp::wrap 
 and Rcpp::as which are highly flexible and extensible, as documented
 in the "Rcpp-extending" vignette.
 .
 Rcpp also provides Rcpp modules, a framework that allows exposing 
 C++ functions and classes to the R level. The "Rcpp-modules" vignette
 details the current set of features of Rcpp-modules. 
 .
 Rcpp includes a concept called Rcpp sugar that brings many R functions
 into C++. Sugar takes advantage of lazy evaluation and expression templates
 to achieve great performance while exposing a syntax that is much nicer
 to use than the equivalent low-level loop code. The "Rcpp-sugar" vignette
 gives an overview of the feature.
 .
 Several examples are included, and 753 unit tests in 338 unit test functions
 provide additional usage examples.
 .
 An earlier version of Rcpp, containing what we now call the 'classic Rcpp
 API' was written during 2005 and 2006 by Dominick Samperi.  This code has
 been factored out of Rcpp into the package RcppClassic and it is still
 available for code relying on this interface. New development should use 
 this package instead.
