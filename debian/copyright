This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-rcpp package of Rcpp, an
R / C++ interface package. Rcpp was written by Dominick Samperi,
Dirk Eddelbuettel and Romain Francois.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/
as well the R-Forge SVN host at 
	http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rcpp/
via
   	svn://svn.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/rcpp


The package was renamed from its upstream name 'Rcpp' to
'r-cran-rcpp' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for
R.

  Description: R/C++ interface classes and examples
   The Rcpp library maps data types betweeen R and C++, and includes support
   for R types real, integer, character, vector, matrix, Date, datetime (i.e.
   POSIXct) at microsecond resolution, data frame, and function. Transfer to and
   from simple SEXP objects is particular easy. Calling R functions from C++ is
   also supported.
   .
   C++ code can be 'inlined' by using the 'inline' package which will create a
   C++ function and compile, link and load it given the 'inlined' character
   argument which makes C++ integration very easy.
   .
   Several examples are included.
  Depends: R (>= 2.0.0)
