### Contributing to Rcpp

Please see the file [Contributing](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/blob/master/Contributing.md) for details on

- how to report an issue: a [Minimally Complete (and) Verifiable Example (MCVE)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) helps a lot;
- how to submit a pull request: post an issue first, get consensus about _what_ and _how_;
- how to follow our (informal) coding style: simply do as other files do and do not invent a new style;
- how to be nice and add [ChangeLog](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/blob/master/ChangeLog) and [NEWS.Rd](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/blob/master/ChangeLog).
