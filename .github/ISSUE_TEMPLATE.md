### Reporting an Issue

Make use of the *Preview* tab just above!

#### Before filing an issue with Rcpp, please ensure that you

- searched the mailing list archives for the [rcpp-devel](https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rcpp-devel) list for the question I want to ask about; you can do this at at Google with the `site:` qualifier as in this simple example: `site:lists.r-forge.r-project.org rcpp-devel how do I declare a const vector`;

- searched the [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) `[rcpp]` tag _e.g._ via `[rcpp] how do I sample a vector`;

- searched existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues) which can be searched among open and closed ones;

- read the [Contributing](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/blob/master/Contributing.md) page for details on preferred reporting and style;

If you have the above, remove the text above and provide a [`Minimally Complete and Reproducible Example`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example), the output of `sessionInfo()` plus relevant information about the C++ compiler.
